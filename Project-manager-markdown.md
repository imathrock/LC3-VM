# Project Description/management markdown
This file just defines objectives and tasks to be done, updated completely at random and will help me stay on track.

## Objectives:
- A well designed RISC V ISA that my vm can execute.
- A state machine that will tell me the current state.
- An instruction file to read instructions from, A memory file that can emulate as the heap and stack. 
- Use some pre built compiler that can translate C into RISCV assembly. 
- A framebuffer display using some C graphics library.

## Tasks
- [X] Create register array and enums that defines all of the registers.
- [X] Create enums for all instructions
- [X] Start Following the LC3 virtual machine tutorial, understand and define the architecture
- [X] Implement all instructions. 
- [X] Create a LC3 state machine
- [ ] Create tests for LC3 ISA
- [ ] Fix the implementation by reimplementing.
- [ ] Write an assembler
