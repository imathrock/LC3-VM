# Project Description/management markdown
This file just defines objectives and tasks to be done, updated completely at random and will help me stay on track.

## Objectives:
- A well designed RISC V ISA that my vm can execute.
- A state machine that will tell me the current state.
- An instruction file to read instructions from, A memory file that can emulate as the heap and stack. 
- Use some pre built compiler that can translate C into RISCV assembly. 
- A framebuffer display using some C graphics library.

## Tasks
- [x] Create register array that defines all of the registers.
- [x] Create enums for all instructions
- [] Create a machine state that holds all information of the CPU's current state.
